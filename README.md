# rustlings-solutions
 This repo contains my solutions regarding the problems proposed by rustlings, divided by category. 
 
 The repo does not allow replication of rustlings (as in the original version) but represents only the collection of solutions. So is possiblo to access to each directory to see the code implemented to solve the exercises proposed.
 
 Comments are still present within the code to easily locate implemented or corrected code.
 
 The solutions concern rustlings version 5.6.1.
 
 Have a good job, rastceans!
