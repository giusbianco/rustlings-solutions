# rustlings-solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the challenges posed by Rustlings, organized by category.
It is worth noting that the repository does not facilitate the replication of Rustlings, as it merely represents a collection of solutions. However, each directory is accessible to view the code implemented to resolve the proposed exercises. 
Comments are present throughout the codebase to aid in locating implemented or corrected code with ease. These solutions are centered on Rustlings version 5.6.1.

I trust that this resource will serve as a valuable reference for Rustaceans seeking to advance their skills.
